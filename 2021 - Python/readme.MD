My Advent of Code submissions. This is the original code I used, with small modifications after-the-fact. As such, they are probably not as efficient or as elegant as they should be.

Part of the idea of AoC is that you have to make some design choices to solve Part 1 before you get to see the instructions for Part 2. So there is a tension of wanting the solution to Part 1 to provide components that can be re-used in Part 2, without falling victim to [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it). In this notebook I won't refactor the code for Part 1 after I see what is requested in Part 2 (although I may edit the code for clarity, without changing the initial approach).

From day 11 I'll be using helper functions and Classes from my own pyaoc library. At some point I'll refactor this library, introduce tests, CI/CD and release to the community.
